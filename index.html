            <h2>Key Events in his Life</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                He was born in 570 CE to Abd Allah bin Al-Muttalib and Amina
                bint Wahb.
              </li>
              <li>He was their first and only son.</li>
              <li>His father passed away shortly before his birth.</li>
              <li>
                He was raised by his mother, who entrusted her son to a wet
                nurse called Halima bint Abi Dhuayb and her husband, who
                belonged to the nomadic tribe of Sa’d ibn Bakr.
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                Muhammad lost his mother when he was 6 years old, after which he
                was passed into the care of Abd al-Muttalib, his paternal
                grandfather.
              </li>

          <h2>Michael H. Hart</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world’s most
              influential persons may surprise some readers and may be
              questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was
              supremely successful on both the religious and secular levels."

          <h2>Annie Besant</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "It is impossible for anyone who studies the life & character of
              the great Prophet of Arabia, …., to feel anything but reverence
              for that mighty Prophet, one of the great messengers of the
              Supreme. And although in what I put to you I shall say many things
              which may be familiar to many, yet I myself feel whenever I
              re-read them, a new way of admiration, a new sense of reverence
              for that mighty Arabian teacher."

          <h2>George Bernard Shaw</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <em>
              "I have always held the religion of Muhammad in high estimation
              because of its wonderful vitality. It is the only religion, which
              appears to me to possess that assimilating capacity to the
              changing phase of existence, which can make itself appeal to every
              age. I have studied him – the wonderful man and in my opinion far
              from being an anti-Christ, he must be called the Savior of
              Humanity. I believe that if a man like him were to assume the
              dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its
              problems in a way that would bring it the much needed peace and
              happiness. I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad that it
              would be acceptable to the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning
              to be acceptable to the Europe of today. If any religion had the
              chance of ruling over England, nay Europe within the next hundred
              years, it could be Islam."

          <blockquote>
            <em>
              “The lies (Western slander) which well-meaning zeal has heaped
              round this man (Muhammad) are disgraceful to ourselves only…How
              one man single-handedly, could weld warring tribes and wandering
              Bedouins into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than
              two decades….A silent great soul, one of that who cannot but be
              earnest. He was to kindle the world, the world’s Maker had ordered
              so.”
